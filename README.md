## Welcome 

I am @chemicalg and I am interested in cheminformatics and data science applications for chemistry. I am a hobby-ist coder having started with Python in 2021.

My longterm vision is to develop tools and methods that guide and support molecular design and chemical synthesis.

I am using this repository as a log and showcase for the projects I am tinkering with.

If you want to get in touch and provide suggestions on improvements you can reach me at: georgekarageorgis@gmail.com

I am always keen to learn and improve.
